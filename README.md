# Scanner and Parser for Tiny Programming Language

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Scanner** and **Parser** for the **Tiny Programming Language** . The project features lexical analysis using regular expressions to tokenize input and syntactic analysis based on a well-defined grammar for the Tiny language.

## Features
1. **Lexical Analysis (Scanner)**:  
   - Tokenizes the input source code into meaningful tokens based on regular expressions.
   - Recognizes keywords, operators, identifiers, constants, and comments.

2. **Parsing (Syntax Analysis)**:  
   - Validates the structure of the Tiny programming language code.
   - Uses a set of production rules to check grammar compliance.
